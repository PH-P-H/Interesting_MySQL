# Interesting MySQL 

##### "My"SQL learning notes

When I first encountered structured query language, I thought it is difficult. Everything seems so rigid, and there are 
so many restrictions. But as I wrote more and more MySQL, things became interesting. By writing queries, I can turn massive 
amounts of data into meaningful information. This kind of chanllenge is like a logic puzzle for me and I get a lot of fun 
everytime I solve a query problem or modify the time efficiency. 

This notebook is divided into two main parts: clues to solve the puzzles (basic knowledge) and some interesting problems 
collected by myself. If youâ€™re also learning MySQL or trying to solve some logic problems, hopefully you can find some 
treasure here.

_I'm still a MySQL learner. The information presented here is not guaranteed to be correct nor accurate, please use at your 
own risk._

**Need to add link to notes and problems**
